# Euclid_Djikstras
Our first try at making an R Package. There are two functions in the package; one implements Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, and the other implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest distance/path from one node to another in a connected graph
